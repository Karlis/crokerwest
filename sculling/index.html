				<h2><a name="scullshafts">Shafts</a></h2>

				<h3><a class="product" name="S39">S39 Arrow</a></h3>
        		<p>The S39 Arrow series are constructed using multiple layers of high modulus carbon fiber at various angles to achieve the perfect balance of strength, longitudinal stiffness and torsional stiffness while maintaining minimum mass. They have a narrow diameter resulting in less aerodynamic and hydraulic drag than our standard shafts.  Additionally, decreased mass results in decreased rotational inertia allowing for higher stroke rates.  These are the lightest sculling oars produced by Croker, and are the lightest scullig shafts in the world. All Arrows are fitted with the newly designed <a class="page-scroll" href="#sculling-blades">Arrow</a> sculling blade.</p>
				<ul>
          			<li><b>S39 (Standard)</b> - Designed for world class, elite level and highly skilled competitive rowers who seek the ultimate propulsion tool with no compromises.  Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times below 6:30 and water times below 7:30 in a 1x.</li>
          			<li><b>S39Soft</b> - Designed for highly competitive lightweights, juniors, masters and openweight women who demand finest and lightest sculling oars in the world.  Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times above 7:00 and water times above 7:45 in a 1x.</li>
        		</ul>
				<br>
				
        		<h3><a class="product" name="S4">S4 Full Carbon</a></h3>
				<p>The S4 Full Carbon series are constructed using multiple layers of standard modulus carbon fiber to achieve a balance between maximal strength and minimal mass - the 100% carbon shaft exhibits a clean and crisp catch.  This has been the oar of choice for anyone with National Team aspirations, as well as for those who want each stroke to feel exquisite. Prior to the development of the Arrow series, the S4 series were the lightest oars available with the lowest rotational inertia.</p>
				<ul>
          			<li><b>S4Stiff</b> - Primarily used by openweight men in quads and doubles at an elite level. The increased stiffness offers maximum force transfer to the blade.</li>
          			<li><b>S4 (Standard)</b> - Designed for men's senior and elite competition, as well as world class elite women. Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times below 6:30 and water times below 7:30 in a 1x.</li>
          			<li><b>S4Soft</b> - Designed for lightweights, juniors, masters and openweight women at the pre-elite to elite level.  The low mass soft shaft provides more flex and increased sensitivity at the catch. Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times above 7:00 and water times above 7:45 in a 1x.</li>
        		</ul>
				<br>

        		<h3 ><a class="product" name="S2">S2 Superlight</a></h3>
				<p>The highly popular S2 Superlight series are constructed using a combinaton of unidirectional and woven carbon fiber (80%) and fiber glass (20%). The result is a good balance of strength and light weight. With a distinct lightweight feel and elite performance superior to heavier oars in common circulation, the S2 Superlight series offers a "step-up" for dedicated scullers while maintaining an affordable price tag.  Although heavier than S39 and S4 series, the S2 series remain amongst the lightest sculling oars available in the world. These are the most popular shafts in North America</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>S2Stiff</b> - Primarily used by openweight men in quads and doubles at an elite level. The increased stiffness offers maximum force transfer to the blade.</li>
					<li><b>S2 (Standard)</b> - Designed for men and women seeking to win at the national level in junior, master and elite competition. Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times below 6:30 and water times below 7:30 in a 1x.</li>
					<li><b>S2Soft</b> - Designed for men and women seeking to win at the national level, but looking for a softer shaft with greater sensitivity at the catch. Ideal for scullers with 2k erg times above 7:00 and water times above 7:45 in a 1x.</li>
        		</ul>
				<br>

				<h3><a class="product" name="S3">S3 Intermediates</a></h3>
				<p>The S3 Intermediate series is a multi-purpose shaft made using a combination of carbon fiber (50%) and fiberglass (50%).  Designed for all levels of racing, this oar has the same shaft stiffness as the S2Soft and is recommended for club use and shared equipment applications. The increased mass of the shaft results in lower sensitivity and increasing stability during the recovery, especially with high winds and inclement weather. Increased durability without a loss in performance makes the S3 Intermediate series ideal for club and school use.</p>

			<!-- Information on Blades -->
				<h2><a name="scullblades">Blades</a></h2>

				<h3>Arrow</h3>
				<p>The new Arrow sculling blade is the latest computer designed blade, specifically developed for use with the new <a class="product" name="S39">S39 Arrow</a> series shafts. They feature FISA minimum blade thickness along the edges and 3D curvature through the body resulting in excellent hydrodynamic efficiency and grip in the water.  The clean entry and exit that Croker blades are well known for is taken to a new level with this new design.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tne new Arrow sculling blade is only available on the S39 Arrow series shafts and are in limited supply.</p>
				
				<h3>Slick</h3>
        		<p>Since its introduction, the Slick blade has undergone several modifications over time and is now available with closed edges, improving the durability and overall performance of the blade.</p>
				<p>The low volume blade enters the water quickly and quietly and floats low in the water. The longitudinal curvature is perpendicular to the tip and in-line with the flow of water. It has a constant pitch across the tip and all lines parallel to the tip. The gentle asymmetric curvature of the blade ensures a clean release from the water with every stroke. Slicks are visibly cleaner than other blades. They do not exhibit any negative tendencies during recovery or in bad weather.</p>
				<p>Since its introduction it has been extremely successful at all levels of rowing.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Slick blade is available on all S4 Full Carbon, S2 Superlight, and S3 Intermediate shafts and can be cut down upon request.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>Macon</h3>
        		<p>The Macon is the original blade shape - first designed in Macon, France.  The Macon design can be seen used by open-water and coastal rowers.</p>

			<!-- Information on Sleeves -->
				<h2><a name="scullsleeves">Sleeves</a></h2>
				<p><em>All Croker oars are fitted with a copolymer, interlocking, injection moulded sleeve and button system.</em> <strong>NOTE: <em>Magik</em></strong> oarlocks are not recommended for use with Croker sleeves.</p>

				<h3>Mk3 - Asymmetric (snap-together)</h3>
				<p>The Mk3 sleeve is the standard sleeve used on all Croker sculling oars.  It features a snap together interlocking clip system with only two flat surfaces.  The asymmetric design reduces the distance between the shaft and the face of the oarlock resulting in improved performance. The geometry provides excellent stability both on the square and the feather.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Mk3 sleeve fits all sculling shafts (S39, S4, S2, S3).</p>
				
				<h3>Mk1 - Standard Symmetric</h3>
        		<p>The original Mk1 standard symmetric sleeve comes in two parts: the sleeve body and the wear plate. The inboard measurements are calibrated on the back of the wear plate. The geometry of the sleeve, provides excellent stability both on the square and the feather. The wear plates can be replaced as required without removing the sleeve.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Mk1 sleeve fits all standard size sculling shafts (S4, S2, S3).</p>
