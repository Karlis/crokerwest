<!-- Information on shafts -->
<h2><a name="scullshafts">Shafts</a></h2>

 <h3><a name="S4">S4 Full Carbon</a></h3>
   <p>These are the lightest oars available and are designed for rowers at an elite level.
	 S4 Full Carbon oars feature the lowest rotational inertia of any Croker sculling shaft.</p>
	 
  <ul>
   <li><b>Stiff</b> - Primarily designed for quads and doubles at an elite level, they offer maximum force transfer to the blade.</li>
	 <li><b>Standard</b> - Designed for quads, doubles and singles at the senior and elite level.</li>
	 <li><b>Soft</b> - Designed especially for women, the soft shaft is for the elite rower looking for more flex in the shaft and sensitivity at the catch.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3><a name="S2">S2 Superlight</a></h3>
  <p>The most popular Croker sculling shaft sold in North America. 
	Designed for highly skilled rowers at junior, senior and elite levels, these oars are low inertia shafts among the lightest sculling oars available.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Stiff</b> - Primarily designed for highly skilled quads and doubles, they offer maximum force transfer to the blade.</li>
	 <li><b>Standard</b> - Designed for highly skilled quads, doubles and singles.</li>
	 <li><b>Soft</b> - Designed especially for highly skilled women, juniors and masters.
	 The Soft shaft is for the rower looking for greater sensitivity at the catch.</li>
  </ul>
 
 <h3><a name="S3">S3 Intermediates</a></h3>
  <p>Designed for all levels of racing, this oar has the same shaft stiffness as the S2 Soft. 
	The increased mass of the shaft makes it heavier in hand, increasing stability during the recovery for the developing sculler. 
	S3's provide increased durability without a loss in performance. Ideal for club and school use.</p>

 <h3><a name="S5">S5 Standards</a></h3>
  <p>Excellent oars for Learn-to-Row programs. 
	The S5 is specifically designed for beginners and school use. 
	The soft shaft of the S5 reduces the chance of over use injuries. 
	The increased mass improves durability and provides increased stability during the recovery.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Information on Blades -->
<h2><a name="scullblades">Blades</a></h2>

 <h3>Slick</h3>
  <p>The Slick blade is Croker's latest CAD CAM computer generated design and supersedes all other blade shapes. 
It is now available with improved closed edges, which improves the durability and overall performance.
Slicks have no ridgeline on the face of the blade and as a result there is less splash at the catch. 
The low volume of the Slick enters the water quickly and quietly and floats low in the water. 
The longitudinal curvature is perpendicular to the tip and so is in line with the flow of water. 
It has a constant pitch across the tip and all lines parallel to the tip.</p>

<p>The gentle asymmetric curvature of the blade ensures a clean release from the water with every stroke. 
Slicks are visibly cleaner than other blades. 
They do not exhibit any negative tendencies during recovery or in bad weather. 
Since its introduction it has been extremely successful at all levels of rowing.</p>

<p>The Slick sculling blade in normally assembled with a 40mm hook. </p>

<p>This provides enough load for the strongest crews but the asymmetric curvature of the blade makes it extremely clean in and out of the water.
A smaller blade is available for women and schoolgirls who want a slightly lighter load at the catch. 
Slick blades are available on all shafts.</p>

<p>Previous blade designs include the Droop Snoot, Cleaver and Macon.</p>

 <h3>Droop Snoot</h3>
  <p>The droop snoot has an asymmetric spoon with a ridgeline across the face for improved stability in the water.</p>

 <h3>Macon</h3>
  <p>The Macon is the original blade shape - first designed in Macon, France.</p>

<hr />

<!-- Information on Sleeves -->
<h2><a name="scullsleeves">Sleeves</a></h2>

<p>All Croker oars are fitted with a copolymer interlocking injection moulded sleeve and button system.</p>

 <h3>Mk3 - Asymmetric (snap-together)</h3>
  <p>This is our newest standard sleeve and supercedes the Mk2 sleeve.  It features a snap together locking system with plastic interlocking clips.  
	 No more screws!  The new sleeves also feature a new more durable material that should stand up to more wear.</p>
	<p>This double ended sleeve performs better because it only has two flat surfaces. 
	 The asymmetric design reduces the distance between the shaft and the swivel face. 
	 The geometry of the sleeve, if combined with oar locks that have a 95-degree inside corner, provides excellent stability at the catch. 
	 It is more stable square or feathered and positive in its movement while squaring and feathering.</p>

 <h3>Mk2 - Asymmetric (screw-together)</h3>
	<p>Symmetric sleeves were originally designed for symmetric Macon oars, where the oar could be used on either strokeside (port) or bowside (starboard).
	 As asymmetrically designed blades have been in use for several years, it is about time that sleeves followed suit.</p>
	<p>The Mark 2 Asymmetric sleeve has been superceded by the new Mark 3 Asymmetric sleeve which uses an interlocking snap together design instead of screws.</p>
	
 <h3>Mk1 - Standard Symmetric</h3>
  <p>The standard sleeve comes in two parts: the sleeve body and the wear plate. 
	 The inboard measurements are calibrated on the back of the wear plate. 
	 The geometry of the sleeve, if combined with oar locks that have a 95-degree inside corner, provides excellent stability at the catch. 
	 The wear plates can be replaced as required without removing the sleeve.</p>
	 
<p><strong>***NOTE: We do not recommended using Magik oarlocks with Croker sleeves as they produce excessive wear on the sleevebody.***</strong></p>

<!-- Information on Handles -->
<h2><a name="scullhandles">Handles</a></h2>

 <p>Most sculling oars are fitted with carbon handles with 6cm of adjustability. 
 Solid timber handles are available on request. 
 Sculling handles are available in three sizes:</p>
<img alt="scullhandles (9K)" src="Images/scullhandles.gif" class="floatrightimg" height="80" width="154" />
  <ul>
	 <li>Large - white end cap. Fit grey and green grips.</li>
	 <li>Medium - yellow end cap. Fit yellow and blue grips.</li>
	 <li>Small - black end cap. Fit pink grips only.</li>
  </ul>
<hr />

<!-- Information on Grips -->
<h2><a name="scullgrips">Grips</a></h2>

  <p>Croker grips are made using an injection molded thermoplastic elastomer, providing improved static friction when wet.
	Growth of bacteria and fungus is controlled by anti-bacterial agents within the grip.
	They are ergonomically shaped to fit different hand sizes - the larger the grip, the greater the spacing between fingers. 
	The grips are color coded for size:</p>
	<img alt="grips (7K)" src="Images/grips.gif" class="floatrightimg" height="100" width="138" />
  <ul>
	 <li>Green - 39mm. For people with large hands.</li>
	 <li>Grey - 37mm.</li>
	 <li>Blue - 35mm.</li>
	 <li>Yellow - 34mm.</li>
	 <li>Pink - 31mm. For people with very small hands.</li>
  </ul>
